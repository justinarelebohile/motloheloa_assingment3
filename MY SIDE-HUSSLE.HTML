        <h1>DOING MAKEUP AND NAILS</h1>
        <p>The wise man once said "There are things to learn enven in most challenging times".In the year
             2020 during lockdown,i learned how to do makeup and nails and that went perfectly fine.
            <br>the aim was to avoid loneliness and stress.Now that is one of my side hussles
            and i'm so proud of myself.

        and second hand shoes when schools are closed and i really enjoy my work.
